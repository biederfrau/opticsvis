        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          Our project idea is to visualize the resulting data from running the
          OPTICS algorithm on a given data set. OPTICS does not generate a
          simple mapping of points to a cluster ID, but rather outputs a list
          of reachability data—that is, the length (given by, e.g., the
          euclidean distance between those two points) that the algorithm had
          to jump from a given point to another. Short distances are preferred by
          the algorithm, so a series of short jumps likely marks a cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, in the end the user is looking at nothing but numbers and has to discern
          the patterns in the data himself. As such, the first step after running OPTICS
          is usually to draw a bar chart, which makes this task much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          As such, visualization is arguably already a core component of cluster analysis
          when using OPTICS. Why not allow for further manipulation of the algorithm, allowing
          to specify parameters such as the minimum point size to qualifiy as a cluster, or the
          cutoff distance that is applied onto the reachability data to define the actual clusters?
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, OPTICS is inherently capable of producing hierarchial
          clusterings, but this information is oftentimes discarded in favor of
          a simpler representation. Procuring an visualization method that is
          still simple, but allows for evaluation of hierarchial clusters is
          surely a worthwile undertaking, and one that we will strive for.

        <h3>Why do this and to what scope?</h3>

        <p>
          Not many tools exist that take on this subject, although notable
          projects exist, especially Clustervision <a href="#clustervision">[1]</a>
          and a DBSCAN visualization that we found <a href="#dbscan">[2]</a>,
          the latter of which only visualizes how DBSCAN goes about finding
          clusters (i.e. shows the epsilon neighborhoods). It is notable that
          DBSCAN results in a simple partition of points into clusters along
          with some metadata (e.g. core points versus edge points).
        </p>

        <p>
          Clustervision is an especially powerful tool and takes on a
          multitude of algorithms (including OPTICS) and offers additional
          tooling like dimension reduction using TSNE. One of the core tasks
          of this tool is to validate the results of the algorithm—i.e.
          enable the user to check out the features of points in a cluster
          and see the relations between data that caused them to be
          classified into the same cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is something that we do not want to do, as we strongly feel that
          this is out of bounds for us. We want to make an example of simple
          data (i.e. low dimensional and spatial, a list of real points) and
          how the results given by OPTICS relate to this data set and the used
          settings, and show the partition derived from the reachability data.

        <div class="img-subtext">Sketch of a preliminary solution.</div>

        <p>
          A preliminary solution could consist out of a scatter plot visualizing the
          input data, a bar plot visualizing the reachability data, as well as a heat
          map that visualizes similarities. Another view may be used to show miscellaneous
          metadata such as the number of points per cluster. A small dashboard is provided
          to change algorithm parameters.
