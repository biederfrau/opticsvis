        <h2>Milestone 1</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Our project idea is to visualize the resulting data from running the
            OPTICS algorithm on a given data set. OPTICS does not generate a
            simple mapping of points to a cluster ID, but rather outputs a list
            of reachability data—that is, the length (given by, e.g., the
            euclidean distance between those two points) that the algorithm had
            to jump from a given point to another. Short distances are preferred by
            the algorithm, so a series of short jumps likely marks a cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, in the end the user is looking at nothing but numbers and has to discern
            the patterns in the data himself. As such, the first step after running OPTICS
            is usually to draw a bar chart, which makes this task much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, visualization is arguably already a core component of cluster analysis
            when using OPTICS. Why not allow for further manipulation of the algorithm, allowing
            to specify parameters such as the minimum point size to qualifiy as a cluster, or the
            cutoff distance that is applied onto the reachability data to define the actual clusters?
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, OPTICS is inherently capable of producing hierarchial
            clusterings, but this information is oftentimes discarded in favor of
            a simpler representation. Procuring an visualization method that is
            still simple, but allows for evaluation of hierarchial clusters is
            surely a worthwile undertaking, and one that we will strive for.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do this and to what scope?</h3>

        <p>
            Not many tools exist that take on this subject, although notable
            projects exist, especially Clustervision <a href="#clustervision">[1]</a>
            and a DBSCAN visualization that we found <a href="#dbscan">[2]</a>,
            the latter of which only visualizes how DBSCAN goes about finding
            clusters (i.e. shows the epsilon neighborhoods). It is notable that
            DBSCAN results in a simple partition of points into clusters along
            with some metadata (e.g. core points versus edge points).
        </p>

        <p>
            Clustervision is an especially powerful tool and takes on a
            multitude of algorithms (including OPTICS) and offers additional
            tooling like dimension reduction using TSNE. One of the core tasks
            of this tool is to validate the results of the algorithm—i.e.
            enable the user to check out the features of points in a cluster
            and see the relations between data that caused them to be
            classified into the same cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is something that we do not want to do, as we strongly feel that
            this is out of bounds for us. We want to make an example of simple
            data (i.e. low dimensional and spatial, a list of real points) and
            how the results given by OPTICS relate to this data set and the used
            settings, and show the partition derived from the reachability data.

        <h2>Milestone 2</h2>
        <h3>Chart Pool</h3>

        Our data is twofold, first: the data to be clustered, and then the actual output (along with metadata that is
        derived from the output).

        <dl class="chart-list">
          <dt>Scatter plot</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Since we've decided to deal with exclusively real-valued data points, a scatter plot
              is a natural visualization choice. However, especially with excessively many points,
              scatter plots may start to become unwieldy, and, especially
              considering svg-drawing in the browser, slow.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Bar chart (split dimensions)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              We feel that given very large data sets, this might be an interesting way to aggregate
              it. It works as follows: the dimensions are split up into two (or however many dimensions
              there are) histograms that bin the number of points given in some range. That way the
              data distribution is visualized.
            </p>

            <p>
              To show the correlation between the two dimensions, we propose that
              we add a color cue.  On hovering a bar, the bars of the other
              dimension will change color to show the distribution of the points
              that were put into the corresponding bin, e.g. turn blue to show that
              few points of the selected bin were put into the other dimension's
              bin or green for quite many.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, this would at best provide a rough overview over the data distribution (which
              is already a pretty sweet deal when you're dealing with Big Data, but we probably won't)
              and might be alienating to any users, who probably expect a simple scatter plot instead.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Heat map (similarities)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This chart displays the points in the output order on both axes and maps the colors
              to the similarity (e.g. inverse distance) of the points. This way, clusters are visible
              along the diagonal. Hierarchial structures are also visible.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Heat map (jump distances)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              An alternative application of a heat map would be to sort of merge the scatter plot
              with a heat map, dividing the area into small rectangles and coloring them according
              to the jumps that were made between points---with small jumps being high similarity.
              This way, we actually display the densities of certain regions, which are already enough
              to reveal any clusters, and get rid of the actual points (which may be toggled on demand)
              to avoid clutter in case of large data.
            </p>

            <p>
              This may, however, be hard to implement---or at least implement so that it works well.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Scatter plot with jump paths</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Another spin on the scatter plot would be to show the actual jumps that the algorithm makes
              between points, like it is done in <a href="#wiki-optics">the graphic at the top of the page</a>.
              This would illustrate how the algorithm works and provide a connection to the reachability data.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Bar chart (reachability)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Although we think that bar charts = boring charts, we think that the reachability is
              best visualized using, well, bar charts. For one part, they allow for easy comparison of
              reachability lengths, as the height of the bar immediately corresponds to the length of the
              jump, so no thinking required.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, bar charts have always been used to visualize the reachability, so it has
              become canon. Someone who is well-aquainted with the algorithm might be thrown off if we
              used something different.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Bar chart (cluster sizes)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              It may be desirable to also show the make-up of the data using the different
              cluster sizes. This can be done using a bar chart.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Bubble chart (cluster sizes)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              It is also possible to display the cluster size information in a more fun way
              by using a bubble chart. However, we feel that the use of spheres may be a bad
              choice---historically, the OPTICS algorithm was a great idea because it is able to
              find clusters that are NOT sphere shaped, by looking at densities. A bubble chart
              looks like clusters, so it may be confusing to imply that the clusters in the data
              are somehow also spherical.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Area chart (clusters with different cutoffs)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The cutoff distance is <em>the</em> parameter to play around with, and can
              drastically alter the resulting clustering. As a reminder, the cutoff distance
              mandates which points (whose jump distances all fall below the cutoff) get lumped
              together in a cluster.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could draw an area chart over different cutoff distances and show how the clusters
              start to fall together given larger cutoffs. This could then be used to indentify critical
              cutoffs, i.e. after how large a cutoff the result starts to be no longer useful. This
              also tells a story on graph hierarchies, with larger cutoffs showing clusters that would be
              further up on the dendogram.
            </p>

            <p>
              This could also be used to display effects of different parameters, e.g. the min points
              parameter. It could also be altered to only show the ratio between points classified as
              noise versus points classified as cluster points.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Dendogram (hierarchial clusters)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              A dendogram is the weapon of choice when wanting to show
              hierarchies in a clustering.  Here, we could define different
              cutoffs for sourcing the data to display, although this might be
              tricky to get to work right on many different data sets.  This
              could be solved by enabling user intervention, i.e. having the
              user pick cutoffs (which is also a great thing to play around
              with).
            </p>

            <p>
              The implementation of this might be a little more involved.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Line chart (points classified over time)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              It might be useful to show the progression of the algorithm over time?
              We could also use an area chart because line charts tend to look flimsy.
            </p>

            The charts [1] and [3] are necessary in each of our visualizations since those are fundamentally important
            for understanding the algorithm. The right hand size charts can be exchanged for other plots that show

                When mousing over any of the bar charts the points belonging to the according cluster will be

          The details on this mockup are not quite accurate but give a rough idea
          of how the results for a given data set may look like.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this mockup, we have picked 5 charts from the chart pool above,
          namely a density map that also shows points (these can be toggled off
          to decrease clutter), a scatter plot that also displays the jumps
          between points that the algorithm made, the good old bar chart that
          shows the reachability distance in the order that the algorithm
          generated them, as well as an area chart that gives an overview over
          how the clusters change with increasing cutoff distances, and another
          simple bar chart that shows cluster sizes (or noise, which are
          aggregated into one pseudocluster) by number of points.
        </p>

        <p>
          The charts are enumerated starting at the top left and clockwise.
        </p>

        <dl class="chart-list">
          <dt>Density map</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This view shows a density map. Since OPTICS is a density-based clustering algorithm,
              displaying the densities is a natural choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              It might be desirable to view the actual points, however, so an
              option for toggling the data points (as in a normal scatterplot)
              should be included. These points could then also be colored to
              correlate with the other views.

          <dt>Bar chart (cluster sizes)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This view shows the cluster sizes. The colors are picked to relate
              to the other views.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Scatter plot with jump paths</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This view shows the data points along with the paths that correlate to the jumps
              displayed in the reachability bar chart. The jumps are colored according to the
              cluster, according to the colors of the bar chart and other views. Hovering a
              bar of the reachability chart should highlight the corresponding edge.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Area chart (different cutoffs)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The area chart shows how the ratio of the different clusters change as the cutoff distance
              increases. This shows some hierarchical information as only adjacent clusters merge. The effect
              can be replicated by dragging the cutoff bar on chart 5.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Bar chart (reachability distances)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This view shows the reachability distances (the lengths of the jumps) in the order
              computed by the algorithm. This is a staple OPTICS chart and would probably be included
              in even the most avant garde OPTICS visualizations.
            </p>

            <p>
              A bar can be used to change the current cutoff distance. Multiple cutoff bars are also
              possible, which would then reveal hierarchical cluster structures (e.g. as shown in the
              density map, with denser inner regions (cores) and less dense outer regions ("suburbs")).

        <h3>Scenario of use</h3>
        <p>
            A typical scenario could be a teacher at a university, wanting to show how OPTICS can be used.
            For this said teacher would first enter data in the corresponding menu and edit the algorithm settings.
            Next the data is shown and the different charts show the clusters and some meta data.
            With those the reachability plot, which usually is the only output, can be further explained for better
            understanding. Additionally the parameters and cutoff line can be adjusted to see how those affect the output.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation details</h3>

        We will be using d3.js.
