          <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          Our project idea is to visualize the resulting data from running the
          OPTICS algorithm on a given data set. OPTICS does not generate a
          simple mapping of points to a cluster ID, but rather outputs a list
          of reachability dataâ€”that is, the length (given by, e.g., the
          euclidean distance between those two points) that the algorithm had
          to jump from a given point to another. Short distances are preferred by
          the algorithm, so a series of short jumps likely marks a cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, in the end the user is looking at nothing but numbers and has to discern
          the patterns in the data himself. As such, the first step after running OPTICS
          is usually to draw a bar chart, which makes this task much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also found, that it is often useful to visualise the data as a Heat-Map,
          which brings the problem of how to order the points for the Heat-Map to be visualy usefull.
          For this reason we propose to order them according to the output of the OPTICS algorithm,
          since similar points are likely to be close to each other. This should result in a map that
          represents the data reduced by their distance to each other coded in with color and with
          that visual and easy to recognize cluster- and subcluster structures.

          <dt>Why is this hard to achieve in existing tools?</dt>
          <dd>
            It's not so hard to achieve, it just seems, that not much work was done on this subject
            and only few implementations of this algorithm are targeted towards casual/non expert analysis
            of clusterdata and are therefor difficult to interpret.<sup>[1]</sup>
